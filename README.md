# MongoDB Docker Playground

This is a my setup for a mongodb playgound

> Note:
> Although the configuration of the Mongo Express service should wait for MongoDB to start up, it is highly likely that during the first startup, Mongo Express will attempt to connect to MongoDB before it has finished setting up the database. If this occurs, simply stop the containers and start them again.

## Setup

Just clone the repository and execute `docker compose up -d`
